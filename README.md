Hello :) ![TweezerURCap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/583ea8c9-e86b-4506-ab50-c5848e6adf12)

In this repo we have two main parts. The first one, the griper simulator, that acts as a server, and second, the griper URCap, with the name Tweezer, that acts as a client.

Font 1: Griper simulator.

Font 2: Tweezer toolbar URCap.

Once you start the server, and open again the toolbar, it establishes a communication with socket in the port 12345 and the IP where the server is.
